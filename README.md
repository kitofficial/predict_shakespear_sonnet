# predict_shakespear_sonnet


It involves a large corpus of Shakespeare's sonnet to train the machine in a way so that it
could predict the next few words of sonnet exactly as what it would be written by
Shakespeare. It was performed by creating n-gram sequences, tokens and applying Bidirectional
LSTM using Keras and TensorFlow library in python.
